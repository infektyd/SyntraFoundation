# 🍎 SYNTRA Chat iOS - Native Migration

runs well with xcode26beta7 (17A5305k) on macos26beta (25a5351b)

### Building
 - from terminal within syntraFoundation root "swift run" and itll have the vapor running at     http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1.
 - i use open web ui to chat with Syntra and test it, i also have Syntra loaded up into xcode beta as an AI assitant, still working on that though.

## Next
- need to work on a better CLI for syntra, and increase its tooling
- going to be expanding in hardware (old idea for this project) ive an ALDL converter build within arduino to read signals being sent to a vehicles ECU.

## Overview

My motivation for this project began with simple curiosity, a pet project meant as a diagnostic tool, and it has since transformed into what you see in this repository. I approached the development with a “why not” mentality, believing that anything is possible in code with persistence and iteration. I have invested significant time and learned across many disciplines to reach this point. This isn’t the end for Syntra; if anything, it’s opened new doors for creativity that I’m eager to explore. 

🧠 SYNTRA

Symbolic Neural Transduction and Reasoning Architecture

The central AI system. “SYNTRA” represents the fusion of symbolic reasoning with real-world signal interpretation. It's the architecture that processes, remembers, and evolves understanding over time. It includes VALON, MODI, and other modules.

⸻

🔧 MODI

Mechanistic Observation and Diagnostic Intelligence

The logic and diagnostics engine. MODI handles grounded, rule-based, cause-effect logic. It tracks fault drift, evaluates sensor patterns, and represents deductive cognition. Think of MODI as the mind that says “if X then Y” — structured and mechanical.

⸻

🔮 VALON

Variable Abstraction and Lateral Ontologic Network

The creative, emotional, and interpretive module. VALON handles symbolic abstraction, emotional anchoring, and lateral (nonlinear) reasoning. It’s the part of SYNTRA that “feels” the meaning of a symbol, forms patterns, and recognizes shifts in intent or tone. It’s more like Jungian symbolic intuition than a logic engine.


This is the **iOS-native migration** of SYNTRA, designed to provide a truly native iOS experience while maintaining all the architecture and capabilities of the original macOS application.

### 🔄 Migration Rationale

- **macOS 26 Beta 3 Bug**: SwiftUI TextField regression causing keyboard input failures  
- **Platform Optimization**: iOS-first design patterns and user experience
- **Future-Proofing**: Native iOS development for App Store distribution
- **Enhanced UX**: Haptic feedback, pull-to-refresh, native keyboard handling

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### iOS-Native Features

- **NavigationStack**: Modern iOS navigation instead of macOS SplitView
- **Bottom Input Bar**: Native iOS chat input with keyboard avoidance
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile responses for interactions and state changes
- **Form-based Settings**: Native iOS settings presentation
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: iOS-standard gesture for SYNTRA reinitialization
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and dynamic type compatibility
- **Multi-orientation**: Support for portrait and landscape on iPhone/iPad

### Consciousness Integration

- **SyntraCore Integration**: Full compatibility with existing consciousness system
- **Three-Brain Architecture**: Valon (moral) + Modi (logical) + Syntra (synthesis)
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second processing limits for mobile UX
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks and user feedback

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Xcode 26+** with 26+ SDK
- **macOS 26+** for development
