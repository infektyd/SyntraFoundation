# 🍎 SYNTRA Chat iOS - Native Migration

## Overview

Starting from zero AI background in February 2025, I approached the development with a "why not" mentality, believing that anything is possible in code with persistence and iteration. I have invested significant time and learned across many disciplines to reach this point. I know SYNTRA isn't the final answer to consciousness - but it's also not just another dead end. This project sits somewhere between breakthrough and experiment, and I think that honest uncertainty is important to acknowledge.  This isn't the end for Syntra; if anything, it's opened new doors for creativity that I'm eager to explore.

🧠 SYNTRA

Symbolic Neural Transduction and Reasoning Architecture

The central AI system. “SYNTRA” represents the fusion of symbolic reasoning with real-world signal interpretation. It's the architecture that processes, remembers, and evolves understanding over time. It includes VALON, MODI, and other modules.

⸻

🔧 MODI

Mechanistic Observation and Diagnostic Intelligence

The logic and diagnostics engine. MODI handles grounded, rule-based, cause-effect logic. It tracks fault drift, evaluates sensor patterns, and represents deductive cognition. Think of MODI as the mind that says “if X then Y” — structured and mechanical.

⸻

🔮 VALON

Variable Abstraction and Lateral Ontologic Network

The creative, emotional, and interpretive module. VALON handles symbolic abstraction, emotional anchoring, and lateral (nonlinear) reasoning. It’s the part of SYNTRA that “feels” the meaning of a symbol, forms patterns, and recognizes shifts in intent or tone. It’s more like Jungian symbolic intuition than a logic engine.


This is the **iOS-native migration** of SYNTRA, designed to provide a truly native iOS experience while maintaining all the architecture and capabilities of the original macOS application.

### 🔄 Migration Rationale

- **macOS 26 Beta 3 Bug**: SwiftUI TextField regression causing keyboard input failures  
- **Platform Optimization**: iOS-first design patterns and user experience
- **Future-Proofing**: Native iOS development for App Store distribution
- **Enhanced UX**: Haptic feedback, pull-to-refresh, native keyboard handling

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### iOS-Native Features

- **NavigationStack**: Modern iOS navigation instead of macOS SplitView
- **Bottom Input Bar**: Native iOS chat input with keyboard avoidance
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile responses for interactions and state changes
- **Form-based Settings**: Native iOS settings presentation
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: iOS-standard gesture for SYNTRA reinitialization
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and dynamic type compatibility
- **Multi-orientation**: Support for portrait and landscape on iPhone/iPad

### Consciousness Integration

- **SyntraCore Integration**: Full compatibility with existing consciousness system
- **Three-Brain Architecture**: Valon (moral) + Modi (logical) + Syntra (synthesis)
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second processing limits for mobile UX
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks and user feedback

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Xcode 26+** with iOS 26+ SDK
- **macOS 26+** for development

make container
```

### Running

1. **Simulator**: Select iOS device in Xcode and run
2. **Device**: Connect iOS device and run with signing profile
3. **TestFlight**: Build for distribution (requires Apple Developer account)

### Build System

```bash
# See all available commands
make help

# Build specific components
make ios-build      # iOS app
make wasm           # WebAssembly modules
make container      # Container images
make test           # Run all tests
```

## 📱 iOS-Specific Features

### Native UI Components

#### ChatInputBar
- Multi-line text input with line limits (1-5 lines)
- Auto-capitalization and smart punctuation
- "Done" keyboard toolbar for dismissal
- Send button with loading states and haptic feedback

#### MessageBubble
- iOS-native message bubble styling
- Context menu for copy/share
- Accessibility labels for VoiceOver
- Different styling for user vs SYNTRA messages

#### SettingsView
- Native iOS Form with sections and footers
- Sliders for moral weight and timeout configuration

### iOS System Integration

#### Haptic Feedback
```swift
// Message sent
UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light).impactOccurred()

// SYNTRA response received
UINotificationFeedbackGenerator().notificationOccurred(.success)

// Error occurred
UINotificationFeedbackGenerator().notificationOccurred(.error)
```

#### Keyboard Management
- Automatic keyboard avoidance
- Smooth animations for keyboard show/hide
- Input focus management with `@FocusState`

#### App Lifecycle
- Background processing pause/resume
- Device capability checking
- Memory and CPU requirements validation

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Processing Timeout | 30s | Maximum time for SYNTRA responses |
| Haptic Feedback | Enabled | Tactile feedback for interactions |
| Auto-scroll | Enabled | Scroll to new messages automatically |
| Moral Weight | 70% | Valon influence in consciousness synthesis |

### Device Requirements

- **Minimum**: iOS 26.0
- **Recommended**: 4+ CPU cores, 4GB+ RAM
