Project Rule 1:

“All agents and contributors must prefer real implementation to stubbing. Any code marked with a stub must be re-addressed and removed as soon as a solution is viable.”

Project Rule 2:

“When designing UI, config toggles, or session logic, default to ‘live binding’—controls change values/behavior instantly and update agents in-memory, not via rebuilds.”

Project Rule 3:

“All architectural/design decisions (including those by AI tools) must be documented in a codex report or markdown in the repo. Major changes with no clear justification should be reverted.”

Project Rule 4:

“New toggles or config options added to SyntraConfig must be fully plumbed from UI → config file → runtime agent logic. All dangling/no-op config UI is forbidden.”

Bonus (Hardening and Compliance)
“All code must pass tests and respect type safety. Silent failing or force-unwrapping is forbidden unless absolutely required and explained.”

“Always update codex_reports/ after substantial work so all progress and decision context is permanent and auditable.”
