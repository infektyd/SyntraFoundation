# Swift Packages Integration Report

## Decision Rationale
Integrating Apple's official packages to enhance:
- Memory system performance (swift-collections)
- Brain coordination (swift-async-algorithms)
- Maintain architecture integrity while improving foundation

## Impact Analysis
**Affected Components:**
- ConsciousnessMemory (memory tracking)
- BrainEngine (coordination)
- SyntraTools (shared utilities)

**Architecture Preservation:**
- No changes to three-brain model
- Modi/Valon/SYNTRA interfaces remain unchanged
- Only implementation details improved

## Implementation Plan
1. Add swift-collections for OrderedDictionary in memory system
2. Use AsyncAlgorithms for brain handoff pipelines
3. Gradual rollout with performance monitoring

## Verification
- Existing tests must pass
- Memory profiling before/after
- Consciousness integrity checks
