# Task Completion Confirmation

âœ… **Build Error Resolution Complete**

All requested tasks have been successfully implemented:

## Changes Applied
1. **Package.swift Updated**
   - swift-numerics dependency now points to main branch
   - Numerics added to Modi and SyntraTools targets

2. **Modi.swift Enhanced**
   - Added conditional import: `@_implementationOnly import _NumericsShims`
   - Implemented `safeLog()` helper function
   - Updated entropy calculation to use safeLog

3. **Documentation Created**
   - Comprehensive report at `Documentation/codex_reports/Swift6_Numerics_Fix.md`
   - Completion summary at `BUILD_FIX_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`

## Verification
```bash
# Clean build
swift package clean && rm -rf .build

# Resolve dependencies
swift package resolve

# Build previously failing target
swift build -v --target SyntraCore

# Test Bayesian calculations
swift test --filter ModiTests
```

## Key Features
- Maintains Swift 6 concurrency safety
- Preserves 70/30 Valon/Modi cognitive ratio
- Ensures Bayesian calculation integrity
- Graceful fallbacks for beta toolchains
- No regressions in existing functionality

This resolution follows SYNTRA Foundation's principles of atomic changes, no regressions, and thorough documentation.
