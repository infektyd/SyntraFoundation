# SwiftUI TextEditor Input Focus Research Brief

## Problem Statement

We have a SwiftUI chat application running on **macOS 26 Beta 3 (Tahoe)** using **Xcode 26 Beta 3** that exhibits a critical text input issue:

- **TextEditor appears properly** with cursor blinking
- **No keyboard input is accepted** - keystrokes produce system beep sounds
- **Programmatic text setting works** (binding is functional)
- **Copy/paste functionality is non-functional**
- **Focus state management appears to work** (visual focus indicators)

## Technical Environment

### System Configuration
- **macOS**: 26 Beta 3 (Tahoe) - bleeding edge
- **Xcode**: 26 Beta 3 
- **Swift**: 6.x
- **SwiftUI**: Latest version with macOS 26
- **Target Platform**: macOS app (not iOS/iPadOS)
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon recommended

### Application Context
- **App Type**: Native macOS SwiftUI application
- **UI Pattern**: NavigationSplitView with chat interface
- **Input Component**: TextEditor (switched from TextField due to known issues)
- **Focus Management**: Using @FocusState property wrapper

## Current Implementation

```swift
@FocusState private var isInputFocused: Bool

TextEditor(text: $inputText)
    .focused($isInputFocused)
    .textSelection(.enabled)
    .disabled(!brain.isAvailable)
    .font(.body)
    .scrollContentBackground(.hidden)
    .background(Color(NSColor.textBackgroundColor))
    .cornerRadius(8)
    .frame(minHeight: 36, maxHeight: 100)
    .onAppear {
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5) {
            isInputFocused = true
        }
    }
    .onTapGesture {
        isInputFocused = true
    }
```

## Known Issues From Research

1. **macOS Sonoma TextField Bug**: `CLIENT ERROR: TUINSRemoteViewController does not override -viewServiceDidTerminateWithError:`
2. **External Keyboard Focus Loss**: TextField loses focus on Return key with external keyboards
3. **DefaultFocus Not Working**: `.defaultFocus` modifier reported as non-functional on macOS

## Research Objectives

### Primary Questions
1. **What are the definitive solutions for SwiftUI text input focus issues on macOS 26 Beta?**
2. **Are there specific workarounds for bleeding-edge macOS versions?**
3. **What NSView/AppKit bridging solutions exist for reliable text input?**
4. **How do other developers handle text input in NavigationSplitView on macOS?**

### Secondary Questions
1. **What window-level focus configurations are required for macOS 26?**
2. **Are there specific DispatchQueue timing requirements for focus management?**
3. **What accessibility or input method conflicts could cause system beeps?**
4. **How does the new macOS 26 input system affect SwiftUI text components?**

## Research Areas to Investigate

### 1. Apple Developer Forums & Documentation
- Search for macOS 26 Beta SwiftUI text input issues
- Look for Xcode 26 Beta known issues with TextEditor/TextField
- Check for FoundationModels API conflicts with input systems
- Investigate NavigationSplitView text input behavior

### 2. SwiftUI Focus Management
- Latest best practices for @FocusState on macOS 26
- Window-level focus coordination techniques
- NSResponder chain integration with SwiftUI
- Alternative focus management libraries or approaches

### 3. System-Level Input Handling
- macOS 26 input method changes
- Accessibility framework interactions
- System beep triggers and prevention
- Keyboard event routing in SwiftUI apps

### 4. Alternative Implementation Patterns
- NSTextView bridging solutions
- UIViewRepresentable/NSViewRepresentable patterns for text input
- Third-party SwiftUI text input libraries
- Hybrid AppKit/SwiftUI approaches

### 5. Beta-Specific Workarounds
- Temporary fixes for bleeding-edge environments
- Known regressions in macOS 26 Beta 3
- Xcode 26 Beta 3 SwiftUI compiler issues
- Preview vs runtime behavior differences

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- Definitive explanation of why keyboard input fails
- System-level vs framework-level issues identification
- Beta stability vs implementation problems

### 2. Solution Recommendations
- **Immediate fixes** that work on macOS 26 Beta 3
- **Fallback approaches** if primary solutions fail
- **Future-proofing** for stable macOS 26 release

### 3. Implementation Guidance
- Step-by-step code modifications
- Configuration changes required
- Testing approaches to verify fixes

### 4. Alternative Architectures
- If SwiftUI solutions are fundamentally broken, what AppKit bridging approaches work?
- Performance and maintainability trade-offs
- Migration path recommendations

## Research Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** - This is blocking development of a cutting-edge consciousness AI system using Apple's FoundationModels APIs. The text input functionality is critical for user interaction with the AI system.

## Additional Context

- This is part of a larger **SYNTRA Foundation** project implementing bleeding-edge consciousness architecture
- The application successfully processes responses when text is set programmatically
- UI layout has been successfully resolved - only text input functionality remains broken
- Previous attempts with TextField, focus delays, window configuration have all failed
- System appears to register keystrokes (beeps) but doesn't pass them to the text component

## Research Methodology

Please prioritize:
1. **Official Apple sources** (developer forums, documentation, WWDC sessions)
2. **Community solutions** from developers working with macOS 26 Beta
3. **Alternative approaches** that bypass the broken SwiftUI path entirely
4. **Systematic debugging techniques** to isolate the root cause
