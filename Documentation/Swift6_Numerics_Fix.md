# Swift 6.2 Beta Numerics Shim Fix (2025-08-15)

## Issue
Build error "missing required module '_NumericsShims'" occurred during emit-module for SyntraCore.swift in Swift 6.2 Xcode beta (arm64-apple-macosx26.0). This was caused by:
- Swift 6.2 beta enforcing stricter module boundaries
- Internal `_NumericsShims` module in swift-numerics v1.0.2 not being properly exposed
- Modi's Bayesian calculations (probability distributions, entropy) requiring numerics functions

## Affected Components
- Modi Bayesian processor
- SyntraCore consciousness integration
- Any module depending on Modi or SyntraCore

## Atomic Fix Implementation
### 1. Package Dependency Update
Updated swift-numerics to main branch for beta compatibility:
```diff
// Package.swift
- .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics.git", from: "1.0.2"),
+ .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics.git", branch: "main"),
```

### 2. Conditional Shim Import
Added beta-safe import guard in Modi.swift:
```swift
// Shared/Swift/Modi/Modi.swift
#if compiler(>=6.0)
@_implementationOnly import _NumericsShims
#endif
```

### 3. Safe Numerics Abstraction
Implemented graceful fallback for log operations:
```swift
private func safeLog(_ value: Double) -> Double {
    #if canImport(_NumericsShims)
    return _NumericsShims.log(value)
    #else
    return Darwin.log(value)
    #endif
}
```

## Verification
- Build commands:
  ```bash
  swift package clean && rm -rf .build
  swift package resolve
  swift build -v --target SyntraCore
  ```
- Test Bayesian integrity with unit tests
- Confirm entropy calculations produce same results as before

## Rollback Plan
1. Revert to tagged release when Xcode 26 GM ships:
   ```diff
   - .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics.git", branch: "main"),
   + .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics.git", from: "1.0.3"),
   ```
2. Remove conditional imports and safeLog wrapper
3. Run full test suite to confirm compatibility

## Prevention Strategy for Future Betas
- Add Swift version check in Package.swift manifests
- Implement CI pipeline with beta toolchain testing
- Create abstraction layers for critical dependencies
- Monitor Apple release notes and dependency repos
- Document beta-specific workarounds in codex_reports

This fix maintains Swift 6 concurrency safety and preserves Bayesian calculation integrity while providing graceful fallbacks for beta toolchain instability.
